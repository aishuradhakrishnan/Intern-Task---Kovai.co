## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the daily public transport passenger journeys data and provide key insights, as well as forecast the passenger numbers for the next 7 days for various service types.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Daily Public Transport Passenger Journeys by Service Type" dataset, which contains the daily passenger journeys for different public transport service types.

## Key Insights
The key insights provided in this project include:
1. Trends or patterns in the data over time
2. Relationships between the different service types
3. Notable differences or outliers in the data
4. Insights into the overall usage and trends of the public transportation system

## Forecasting
The project uses an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the passenger journeys for the next 7 days for the following service types:
- Local Route
- Light Rail
- Peak Service
- Rapid Route
- School

## Technical Report
The technical report provides details about the chosen forecasting algorithm (ARIMA), the model parameters, and the rationale for selecting ARIMA.

## Usage
To use this project, you can run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.
